          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            Nexus is an Agile framework designed to scale Scrum for large product and
            software development initiatives. <br />It addresses the challenges that
            arise when multiple Scrum teams work together on a single product, such as
            coordination, integration, and communication. <br />
            By using Nexus, organizations can ensure that all teams are aligned,
            working efficiently, and delivering high-quality integrated increments.

          <h3>What is Nexus?</h3>
          <p>
            Nexus is a framework that builds upon Scrum, providing additional
            structure for scaling Scrum to handle large-scale, complex projects
            involving multiple Scrum teams. <br />It introduces specific roles,
            events, and artifacts to manage dependencies and integration challenges
            effectively.

              <strong>Nexus Sprint Planning:</strong> Teams collaboratively plan their
              sprints, focusing on integration and coordination.
              <p>
                Example: Each team identifies their sprint goals and tasks, ensuring

              <strong>Nexus Daily Scrum:</strong> A daily meeting to discuss progress,
              integration challenges, and dependencies.
              <p>
                Example: Teams share updates, address blockers, and synchronize their
                work.

                Example: Teams demonstrate the integrated product increment and gather
                feedback.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>

              reflect on the past sprint and identify improvement opportunities.
              <p>
                Example: Teams discuss what went well, what didn't, and how to improve
                integration and collaboration.
              </p>
            </li>

              teams at the end of each sprint, which must meet the Definition of Done.
              <p>
                Example: Perform integration testing and quality assurance throughout
                the sprint.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Nexus Goal:</strong> A shared objective that guides the Scrum
              teams throughout the sprint.
              <p>
                Example: Use the Nexus Goal to guide decision-making and
                prioritization.
