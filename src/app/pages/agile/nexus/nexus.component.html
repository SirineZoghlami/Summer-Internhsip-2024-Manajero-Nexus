  <h1>Nexus Agile Methodology</h1>
  <img src="assets/images/nexus.png" alt="Illustration of Nexus Framework" class="img">

  <p>Nexus is an advanced framework designed to scale Scrum by coordinating the efforts of multiple Scrum teams working on a single product. It addresses the complexities that arise when organizations scale Scrum beyond a single team, focusing on reducing cross-team dependencies and integration issues.</p>
  
  <h2>Principles of Nexus</h2>
  <p>Nexus builds on the foundations of Scrum, emphasizing transparency, inspection, and adaptation. It introduces a layer of integration that helps multiple teams to effectively work together towards a common goal.</p>

  <h2>Key Components of Nexus</h2>
  <p>Nexus extends Scrum by adding specific roles, events, and artifacts designed to integrate the work of several Scrum teams:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Nexus Integration Team (NIT):</strong> This team is responsible for ensuring that a "Done" Integrated Increment is produced at least every Sprint. It includes the following roles:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Product Owner:</strong> Manages the Product Backlog and ensures that priorities are clear and visible.</li>
        <li><strong>Scrum Master:</strong> Facilitates Nexus events and ensures that obstacles affecting more than one team are addressed.</li>
        <li><strong>Integration Team Members:</strong> Typically technical members from each Scrum team who focus on resolving integration issues.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Integrated Increment:</strong> The sum of all integrated work completed by the Scrum teams, which must be in a usable condition and meet the definition of "Done".</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Core Events</h2>
  <p>Nexus enhances Scrum by introducing additional events that foster better coordination and integration among teams:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Nexus Sprint Planning:</strong> This event involves representatives from each Scrum team to plan and coordinate work for the upcoming Sprint, ensuring alignment and addressing dependencies upfront.</li>
    <li><strong>Nexus Daily Scrum:</strong> A 15-minute time-boxed event for key representatives from each Scrum team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours. This meeting helps surface any integration challenges that could impact progress.</li>
    <li><strong>Nexus Sprint Review:</strong> During this event, the Nexus presents the Integrated Increment to stakeholders to gather feedback that will guide the next Sprint's work.</li>
    <li><strong>Nexus Sprint Retrospective:</strong> After the Sprint Review, this event allows the Nexus to reflect on the past Sprint and form a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Benefits of Nexus</h2>
  <p>Implementing Nexus in projects with multiple Scrum teams offers several benefits:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Enhanced Collaboration:</strong> Nexus fosters a collaborative environment that is essential for scaling agile practices effectively.</li>
    <li><strong>Reduced Integration Issues:</strong> Regular integration and the focus on a single Integrated Increment reduce the risks of significant integration problems at the end of the project.</li>
    <li><strong>Improved Transparency:</strong> Frequent integration ensures that issues are identified and addressed promptly, keeping all stakeholders well-informed about project progress and challenges.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p>While beneficial, Nexus also presents challenges that need to be managed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Increased Complexity:</strong> The coordination of multiple teams adds layers of complexity that require robust communication channels and clear governance.</li>
    <li><strong>Resource Intensiveness:</strong> The additional roles and events introduced by Nexus demand more time and resources, which can strain smaller organizations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Nexus is ideal for medium to large projects where multiple Scrum teams need to work in sync to deliver a cohesive product. It provides a structured approach to scaling Scrum by fostering better integration and collaboration, ensuring that the collective efforts of all teams are aligned and focused towards achieving the project goals.</p>
